# Triangle Area Calculator

## Description
A lightweight console application written in C++ that calculates the area of a triangle. The program prompts the user to input the base length and height, processes the inputs using a dedicated calculation function, and outputs the resulting area.

## Features
* **Modular Functionality:** Utilizes a distinct `area()` function to separate the mathematical logic from the main execution block.
* **Precision Handling:** Implements `double` data types to accurately calculate and display decimal values.
* **English Console Interface:** Follows universal coding standards with full English variables and terminal prompts.

## How to Run
1. Compile the source file using a standard C++ compiler (e.g., `g++ main.cpp -o triangle_calculator`).
2. Run the generated executable in your terminal.
3. Enter the requested numerical values for the base and height when prompted.
